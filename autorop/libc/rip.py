    We can programmatically find and download libc based on function address leaks
    (two or more preferred). This function sets ``state.libc``, including setting
    ``state.libc.address`` for ready-to-use address calculation.

    Arguments:
        state: The current ``PwnState`` with the following set

            - ``leaks``: Leaked symbols of libc.

    Returns:
        Mutated ``PwnState``, with the following updated

            - ``libc``: Path to ``target``'s libc, according to https://libc.rip.
